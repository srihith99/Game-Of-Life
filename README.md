# Game-Of-Life
To run the game of life:
python Game_of_Life.py number_of_live_cells

example: python Game_of_Life.py 5

Then you can select 5 live cells and the Game Of Life starts.
Default live cells are initialised to 12 so if number of live cells is not given you need to enter 12 cells for the program to start.
